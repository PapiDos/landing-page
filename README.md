# Landing Page Project

This is a landing page project. I chose [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum as the theme for this project for I feel grateful I'm learning to code with them.

## Project Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to implement what I've learned so far (HTML & CSS) in the Foundation course of The Odin Project.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox)
- Git
- GitHub
- Bash

## Future Enhancements

As I progress through the curriculum, I might revisit this project to add some functionality with JavaScript.
